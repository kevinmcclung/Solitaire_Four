# Solitaire_Four

Since renamed Psychic 2 Skeptic, the purpose of this app is to prevent people from wasting their money on fake psychics. It is similar to Tic Tac Toe and Connect Four, but the difference is that it is meant for one player. A plus or minus sign will appear at random on each square, so a true psychic would have to be able to predict a winning combination. You can adjust the probability of a win with the difficulty settings bar.
